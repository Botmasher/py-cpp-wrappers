  	Tips from http://intermediate-and-advanced-software-carpentry.readthedocs.io/en/latest/c++-wrapping.html:
  		1. if you receive a Python object from the Python API, you can use it within your own C code without INCREFing it.
			2. if you want to guarantee that the Python object survives past the end of your own C code, you must INCREF it.
			3. if you received an object from Python code and it was a new reference, but you donâ€™t want it to survive past the end of your own C code, you should DECREF it.
			4. if you wanted to return None, by the way, you can use Py_None. Remember to INCREF it!

// 2. register Python-callable function within module's symbol table
static PyMethodDef HelloMethods[] = {
	{ "test", test_func, METH_VARARGS, "Test return string" },
	{ NULL, NULL, 0, NULL }
};

// 3. write init function for this module (required for all extension modules)
DL_EXPORT(void) inithello(void) {
	Py_InitModule("hello", HelloMethods);
}

// 4. write setup.py (see that file)

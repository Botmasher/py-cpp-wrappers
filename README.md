# Test wrapping C++ code for Python

Some simple examples playing with C++ wrapping options mainly following [this site](http://intermediate-and-advanced-software-carpentry.readthedocs.io/en/latest/c++-wrapping.html).

Included and adjusted examples of wrapping from scratch (see `./by-hand`) vs using SWIG (`./swig`), SIP (`./sip`) or Pyrex (`./pyrex`).
